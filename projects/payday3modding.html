                        With the release of Payday 3, I quickly became interested in modifying the game to add features and mechanics that would personalise the game for myself.
                        Luckily Payday 3 runs on Unreal Engine, which I have had previous experience with. This lead me to joining in with the modding community, helping with 
                        reverse engineering specific functions and replicating them with our own mods. 
                        <br><br> 
                        Overall this has been a great experience with working with an actual published game and I have picked up a lot of skills from working with the in-game functions
                        and have learned a lot about how games structure their code and assets.

                        One of the first mods I released was the <a class="text-link" href="https://modworkshop.net/mod/44826">Animated Subway Surfer Phone Screen</a>,
                        which replaced the usual phone screen texture with an animated version of the phone, showing Subway Surfer gameplay instead. It initially started of as a joke/gimmick
                        mod but it became a way for me to learn about making logic mods.
                        <br><br> 
                        After showing a few other players the mod and having many mod makers asking how I made it, I realised that having an animated phone screen was 
                        a feature that many players desired. So I took on the challenge of creating a base template/framework for other mod makers to easily use to
                        develop their own animated phone screen replacements. This template allowed for greater customisation and personalisation to the game.
                        <br><br>
                        This lead to me developing the <a class="text-link" href="https://modworkshop.net/mod/44827?tab=description">Animated Phone Screen Template and Guide</a>,
                         which taught people how to make their own animated phone screen mods. The guide featured a worded instruction page along with a voiced video guide. This spawned
                        a wave of animated phone screen mods populating the mod workshops.
                        <br><br>
                        There was a also few other mods that spawned from my animation logic, like the <a class="text-link" href="https://modworkshop.net/mod/45222">Starry Night Animated Gloves</a>.

                        While working on my own mods, I had the opportunity to work with other mod makers and helped with the creation of a few different mods. One of the mods I got to contribute to was the 
                        <a class="text-link" href="https://modworkshop.net/mod/44921?tab=description">Challenge Notifications from Sanic</a>, which displayed an on screen notification upon completion
                        of challenges mid heist. I worked on the UI for this mod, designing a concept for how the notification will look on the HUD and creating the final UI assets used in the widgets. I tried to
                        keep the UI elements in theme with how the default HUD looked.
                        <br><br>
                        <img class="preview-image" src="/assets/payday3-ui-concept.png" alt="Ui concept made for challenge notifications">
                        <br><br>
                        Working with the same mod maker, we developed a proof of concept for a custom weapon skin framework. The idea was that people would be able to create their own skins for any weapon they would like.
                        I worked on the menu for this mod and had to learn how to hook widgets and UI elements into the main menu widget. During the development, I learned the process of dynamically spawning UI elements
                        and how the menu in games work. Although, this mod was never finished or published anywhere, it was a great learning experience with working with other developers and comunicating. 
                        
                        Here is how the menu turned out:

                        As my current modding project, I am working on redesigning the player HUD with a simplified minimalistic version. This modification is still currently in progress
                        and aims to be the first released full customised HUD mod. To get the UI elements working, I have had to read through the Payday 3 c++ and UE4 functions and variables to see
                        where the relevant infomation that I need is stored. 
                        <br><br>
                        As of the moment the client's health, armor, overkill progress, ammo and downed count have been displayed on the HUD. Along with that, the AI crew health is also working as intended.
                        I am now working on getting the online crew that have joined the sessions and displaying their statistics on the HUD.  
                        <br><br>
                        Here is the HUD in its current state, show in working game:
